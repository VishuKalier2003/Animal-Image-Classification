# ${Animal \space Image \space Classification}$


## ${Project \space Overview}$

The Project deals with the classification of ***Images into Images of Dog or Cat***. No Image has both Dog and Cat in the same frame. The Image 
Classification is performed using ***Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)***. The Images are resized and then trained to achieve an ***accuracy of 98% (approx.)*** 
The project can be used to as a ***good processing and Classification tool*** on Image datasets. It can also be ***further enhanced to classify more 
number of pets and Animals***.
The ***Project Structure*** describes the Project structure and the information which each subfolder contains.
